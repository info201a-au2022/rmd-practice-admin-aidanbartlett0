## Covid Report

The COVID 19 that we are measuring begins in early 2020, and as the date goes on, you can see a gradual increase in cases for about 6 months, then, almost immediately there is an immediate spike in cases that never really levels off. In these two years measured, there was a total of `r get_total_cases()` cases compared to `r get_total_deaths()` deaths. At the beginning of 2022, there was a massive spike in cases, so much so that the line of the graph goes almost vertical. Imagine a graph of the deaths, there would likely be a massive spike of deaths right there as well wouldn't there be?
